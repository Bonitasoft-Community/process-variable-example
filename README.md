# Process variable example

## Description
Example of forms to display and update a text process variable

## Important recommendations
Generally it is recommended to use business variables instead of process variables.

## Known limitation
By default only users with administrator profile are allowed to access process variables.
You can change such behavior by customizing dynamic-permissions-checks.properties. Refer to [REST API authorization](http://documentation.bonitasoft.com/rest-api-authorization-0) documentation for more information.

Overview form is not able to display process variable value for an archived process instance (lack of REST API).

## Compatibility
This example has been created and built with Bonita BPM 7.1.5 Community edition.
It should be compatible with any newer version as well as Subscription edition.

## Issues
Reports issues and improvement request on GitHub tracker.
